<h1>how 2 yewse?</h1>
Just paste these code pieces into the dev console. Simple. You do this with almost everything here, although you can make them into bookmarklets
<h1>How do you use ThwompTOOLS?</h1>
<ul><b>ThwompTOOLS.js
</b> - If you've ran the code successfully, a blue HTML menu shall appear with 10 options. You can use this panel for an impersonation troll that makes it looks like somebody else said something awkward or funny. Here is a quick explanation of each option. </ul>
<h2>Mimic <small>(the one you're probably here for)</small></h2>        
<p>First, you need to think of a person in the server you want to turn into. </p> <p> Observe their name, their color, and their hat (if they have one).</p> <p> Match the panels below with the user's outfit.</p> <p> For example, if there is a user called Muglet, 
  who uses the cyan color and the wizard hat, you'll want to change the COLOR panel to cyan, the HAT panel to wizard, and type "Muglet" into the NICKNAME box. </p> <p>  Then type what you want the fake version of them to say. </p> <p>  Now, if you want to give the illusion that they said something they didn't, you will need a psuedo nickname (which can be entered into the 2ND NICKNAME box) that you will have after 1 second of activating it. </p> <p>  Once you fill in all the boxes, just press "START". </p> <p> You should turn into a near perfect clone of the user you want to turn into, say the thing in the text bubble, and after 1 second or so, turn back to a version of yourself with a random color and hat, to not draw suspicion.</p>

<P>Small note: For more authenticity, use the same markdown that the target of the Mimic command has. For example, if they have the Rainbow and Bold markdown in their names, you'll type $ r $**[THEIR NAME] (with no spaces) into the NICKNAME box.</P>
</ul>
<h2>Spamming</h2>
<p>This is relatively simple. Type the text you want to spam into the "TEXT TO SPAM" box, then click "SPAM".</p>
<p>Colorspamming just requires you to click the "COLORSPAM" button, which will make you repeat the color command.</p>
